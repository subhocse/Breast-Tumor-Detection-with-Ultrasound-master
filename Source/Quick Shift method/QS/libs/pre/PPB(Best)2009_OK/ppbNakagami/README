This MATLAB software implements the denoising algorithm (the Probabilistic
Patch-Based filter) for images damaged by multiplicative Nakagami-Rayleigh
noise as presented in: "Iterative Weighted Maximum Likelihood Denoising
with Probabilistic Patch-Based Weights", C-A. Deledalle, L. Denis and
F. Tupin, IEEE Trans. on Image Processing, vol. 18, no. 12, pp. 2661-2672,
December 2009. It also corresponds to the NL-SAR filter: "A non-local
approach for SAR and interferometric SAR denoising", C-A. Deledalle,
Florence Tupin and Lo√Øc Denis, in the proceedings of IGARSS, Honolulu,
Hawaii, USA, July 2010.

This software is free and should be used only for nonprofit purposes. Any
unauthorized use of this software for industrial or profit-oriented
activities is expressively prohibited.

The program has been written for MATLAB with the ImageProcessing Toolbox
for Linux 32-bit or 64-bit and Windows 32-bit or 64-bit.

The following program files are present:

- ppbNakagami.mex*:
  A Mex function wich performs one iteration of the denoising algorithm.

- ppb_nakagami.m:
  A matlab function wich calls the ppbNakagami.mexglx program to perform the
  iterative denoising. This function realize also a wrapping of the
  arguments which can be then given as described in our paper. Please refer
  to our paper for a more detailed description of the arguments. Note that
  this function ables to treat large images by preserving memory thanks to
  a block processing on 1024x1024 subimages.

- example_nakagami.m:
  An example of how to use the PPB filter. It denoises the Lena image
  (lena.png) corrupted by multiplicative Nakagami-Rayleigh noise with
  equivalent number of look 3. The PPB filter is used with 2 sets of
  parameters. One applies the non-iterative PPB filter, the other one
  performs 4 iteration of the PPB filter with an initial estimate computing
  also with the PPB filter with a smaller search window size.

- psnr.m:
  Computes the PSNR values.

- snr.m:
  Computes the SNR values.

- plotimage.m:
  Plot a grayscale image with pixel values ranged on [0..255].

- plotimage_sar.m:
  Plot a SAR amplitude image by rescaling the range of the image on the
  intervale [0..mean + 3 sigma].
